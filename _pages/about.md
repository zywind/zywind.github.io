I am a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Twitter's Machine Learning Ethics, Transparency and Accountability (META) team.
Previously, I was a research scientist at IBM Research AI.
My research focuses on the intersection between AI and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).
I am passionate about developing fair, transparent, and trustworthy AI, as well as making machine learning systems more understandable and user friendly.
My recent research projects include [AI Fairness 360](https://aif360.mybluemix.net){:target="_blank"} and [AI Explainability 360](https://aix360.mybluemix.net){:target="_blank"} toolkits, chatbot development framework, multi-modal interactive systems, modeling social interactions, and understanding and remediating cognitive biases.

I was laid off from Twitter and am on the job market now. I am an engineer as well as an AI and HCI researcher. At Twitter, I developed a distributed model evaluation system for evaluating model performance and fairness.
Prior to joining Twitter, I was a research scientist at IBM Research AI.
I am passionate about developing fair, transparent, and trustworthy AI, as well as making machine learning systems more understandable and user friendly.
My recent projects include [AI Fairness 360](https://aif360.mybluemix.net){:target="_blank"} and [AI Explainability 360](https://aix360.mybluemix.net){:target="_blank"} toolkits, chatbot development framework, multi-modal interactive systems, modeling social interactions, and understanding and remediating cognitive biases.
